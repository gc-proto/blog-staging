<h1>Making sure content on Canada.ca is up to date</h1>
<!-- <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2017-12-12T08:48:44+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">February 22, 2018</time></p> -->


<p>In a recent usability study, we saw people disregarding Canada.ca search results that seemed too old. However, the content was perfectly valid and had just been reviewed. We can help show that content is up to date by indicating when pages were last reviewed for accuracy. </p>

<!-- <p>We had some interesting results related to content age in a recent usability study. It showed us about how people perceive content based on its age. This might influence how we present the date updated on Canada.ca.</p> -->

<h2>Seeing how old content is</h2>

<p>Currently, there are two main ways to tell how up to date content is on Canada.ca. One is in a standard place on each page:</p>

<img style="border: 1px solid #cdcdcd" src="../../../../images/pagewithdate-small-en.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing date modified on a typical Canada.ca page" />

<p>(You'll see the date this post was published if you look down on this page.)</p>
<p>Since it's in the same place on every Canada.ca web page, people can count on finding it if they want to know how current the information is.</p>

<p>The second place people see the date is in search engine results. Both on Google:</p>

<img style="border: 1px solid #c7c7c7" src="../../../../images/blog-date-google-serp-828x284-en.png" alt="Google results page showing a Canada.ca result (Vaccinations and pregnancy) with date highlighted">

<p>...and on Canada.ca search:</p>

<img style="border: 1px solid #c7c7c7" src="../../../../images/blog-date-canadadotca-serp.png" width="828" alt="Canada.ca results page showing a result (Vaccinations and pregnancy) with date highlighted">

<p>In the design guidance for Canada.ca, we say that you should:</p>

<p>"Use the date modified component to provide a person with the date that the content was last updated."</p>

<ul><li> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/headers-footers-navigation.html#toc3">Headers, footers and navigation for Canada.ca</a></li></ul>

<p>But if there's no reason to update the content, that date won't change. It can start to look old even if it's still accurate.</p>

<h2>Why content age matters</h2>

<p>People really notice the age of the content presented, especially if it's a subject that can be out of date quickly. Health information definitely fits into that category. How recent the content is (also called it's "currency") is a key way people tell how credible it is.</p>

<!-- <p>Here's a video of a usability test participant disregarding the best page to solve his task due to its age (voice disguised):</p> -->
<h2>Watch people disregarding old content</h2>

<p>Here Canadians are trying to see if pregnant women can get the flu shot (they can and should!). Here's what happens when they see that content is from more than 2 years ago:</p>

				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(Participant 1)</p>
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(Video showing someone looking at a Canada.ca search results page. Text appears pointing to a result for "Vaccination and pregnancy", which has a date of "June 20, 2015".)</p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="6.02s" data-dur="6.84s">And, so this is from 2015 so I'll just scroll down a little bit to see if maybe...</span></p>
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(The picture zooms into filter controls on the side of the page. The mouse moves over "By date: Past year" and clicks the link.)</p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="14.12s" data-dur="4.84s">...maybe from the past year - I'll filter my results...</span></p>
				
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(The search results reload and the Vaccination and pregnancy page is gone.)</p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="17.12s" data-dur="4.84s">...in case there's something more current.</span></p>
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(Text appears saying that "The filter hid the best result".)</p>
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(Participant 2)</p>
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(Someone is looking at a Canada.ca search results page on a mobile phone.)</p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="26.12s" data-dur="3.84s">This information goes back to 2015.</span></p>
				
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(They tap the first result and see the Vaccination and pregnancy page. They begin scrolling down.)</p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="29.00s" data-dur="4.84s">I wonder if there's anything that's newer than that.</span></p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="32.00s" data-dur="3.84s">Although that's still pretty current...</span></p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="36.41s" data-dur="3.84s">...I'd feel better if there was something a little newer.<span></p>				
				
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(Participant 3)</p>
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(Another person on a different mobile phone is looking at Canada.ca search results. They scroll down and look at the first result.)</p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="47.72s" data-dur="3.84s">Vaccination and pregnancy ok...</span></p>
				<p class="wet-boew-vd">(They seem ready to tap the link to the page, but hesitate.)</p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="52.42s" data-dur="3.84s">...but that's like from 2015</span></p>
				<p><span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="55.12s" data-dur="3.84s">Where's the latest information from it?</span></p>

<p>Even if the information is perfectly valid, people still thought there should be something newer.</p>

<h2>Review content regularly to keep it up to date</h2>

<p>We should be review content regularly as part of our content management lifecycle. How often you review depends on the content. Medical and scientific information is clearly should be reviewed more frequently.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that a page you review may not need any updates. All of the information is still valid, and no changes are needed. It might then seem less trustworthy, even though the information is still as valid as when it was written.</p>

<h2>If content is still valid, update the date modified</h2>

<p>If you've done a full review of the content and decided it's still valid, then you can update the date modified to the date of the review. The date issued remains the same, but this provides a signal that the content has been assessed and is still current.</p>

<h2>When not to update the date modified</h2>
<p>Knowing the actual date something was modified or reviewed is important. Don't update the date modified of pages just because you want to make them look new. It should only be done as part of a content lifecycle review process that has actually determined that the content is still valid. </p>
